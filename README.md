## About CogAI Chunk (CNK) files

Chunk files are a simple text format for storing and sharing knowledge.  They are designed to be human readable and editable, and to be machine readable and processable for current and future Cognitive AI software and systems. The technology is being designed by the W3C Cognitive AI Community Group (CG) Members. 

The best place to get more information about the W3C CG Cognitive AI CNK files is via the W3C CG: https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/ 

More information is also provided via the [CogAI GitHub Link](https://github.com/w3c/cogai/) and the specification development document for chunk files is available at: https://w3c.github.io/cogai/chunk.html
